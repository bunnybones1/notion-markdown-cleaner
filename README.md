# Notion Markdown Cleaner

Notion's markdown exports are fantastic, but the folders and filenames have formatting issues that make them difficult to maintain and share.

This tool will solve that! No installation necessary!

## Usage

If you have node installed, you have npm! 

And if you have npm v5.2.0 installed, you have npx!

In a terminal:

`npx github:bunnybones1/notion-markdown-cleaner path-to-notion-folder`
